# Nix expressions for Firefox addons

This flake provides about **30,000 addons** from https://addons.mozilla.org/ as Nix packages. (with more to come!)

## Inspiration

- [rycee's NUR expressions](https://gitlab.com/rycee/nur-expressions) containing expressions for Firefox addons
- [montchr's firefox-addons](https://github.com/seadome/firefox-addons) also containing Nix expressions for Firefox addons
- [VSCode extensions Nix expressions by nix-community](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions) as a rolemodel of scale
